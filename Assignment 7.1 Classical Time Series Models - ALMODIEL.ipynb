        "\n",
        "* According to the wikipedia, A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. For example, stock prices over a fixed period of time, hotel bookings, ecommerce sales, waether cycle reports etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Autocorrelation is the most important concept in time series. It is precisely what makes modeling them so difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Autocorrelation is the measure of the degree of similarity between a given time series and the lagged version of that time series over successive time periods. It is similar to calculating the correlation between two different variables except in Autocorrelation we calculate the correlation between two different versions Xt and Xt-k of the same time series\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* If you swap the first and tenth observations in tabular data, the data has not changed one bit. If you swap the first and tenth observations in a time series, you get a different time series. Order matters. Not accounting for autocorrelation is almost as silly as this timeless classic.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Another useful method to examine serial dependencies is to examine the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) â€“ an extension of autocorrelation, where the dependence on the intermediate elements (those within the lag) is removed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Serial dependency for a particular lag can be removed by differencing the series. There are two major reasons for such transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* First, we can identify the hidden nature of seasonal dependencies in the series. Autocorrelations for consecutive lags are interdependent, so removing some of the autocorrelations will change other auto correlations, making other seasonalities more apparent.\n",

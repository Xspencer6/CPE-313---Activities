Hello, world! I'm Spencer Almodiel, I have a passion in coding since I am curious about how applications work ever since I was a kid. During my free time, I mostly play computer games and sometimes when diligence strikes, I solve competitive programming problems on Leetcode or Codewars. I enjoy programming mostly in C++ and Python, it feels rewarding whenever I solve a difficult problem with C++.
